Implementation of grep using rust. I decided it would be fun to try to fully implement the functionality of grep using Rust. As of v0.3.0, greprs supports basic string and pattern searches of multiple files and currently supports the options: case-sensitive, invert match, and output line counting. You can find more information about the original grep [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/).

### Documentation
##### Build and Install (Linux)
Clone git repo and build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CODYJEWELLWEAVER/greprs.git
cd greprs
cargo build & cargo test
```


You can install the binary to your path by using 
```bash
cargo install --path <path/to/greprs>
```

##### Usage
greprs can be run using the following syntax
```bash
greprs [-q:<query>,...] [<path/to/file>,...] [<option>,...]
```
You can use the following for single query searches
```bash
greprs query [<path/to/file>,...] [<options>,...]
```
Note that to use this syntax the query should be before all files and options.

You can specify multiple queries with the following notations
```bash
-q:<query> -q:<query> ... or -q:<query>:<query>:...
```

###### Usage Example
```bash
greprs -q:is -q:Thee res/test/*
Searching for: ["is", "Thee"]
In: <res/test/haiku.txt> <res/test/poem.txt> 

<res/test/poem.txt>     And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
<res/test/poem.txt>     Nor shall death brag thou wanderâ€™st in his shade,
<res/test/poem.txt>       So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

<res/test/haiku.txt>    This world of dew
<res/test/haiku.txt>    is a world of dew,
```
