# greprs
Implementation of grep using rust. The idea came from the book: "The Rust Programming Language". The book shows how to implement a very basic implementaion of grep in Rust. I decided it would be fun to try to fully implement the functionality of grep using Rust. All credit for the idea goes the the authors of "The Rust Programming Language".
